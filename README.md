# YuME
YuME is a map editor extension that allows for the rapid creation of game levels using a set of 3D 'tile' prefabs. 

YuME has been on the Unity Asset Store for 6 years - and it's time to be open-sourced is well overdue. I haven't had much time in the last few years to spend on personal Unity projects. However I did put together a little demo game in Xmas of 2021 that used YuME extensively and I was suprised how well it had held up over the years of no updates.

If you purchased YuME in the past - I'd like to thank you for your support and I hope it helped in the development of your projects.

Here's the blerb from the asset store:

YuME comes with a 50 prefab tileset for prototyping your levels, as well as tools to convert your own artwork and existing assets into a format that can be used by YuME.

Features:
- Intuitive tools for level creation
- Keyboard shortcuts designed to speed up your work flow
- Tools to import your own artwork into YuME
- Tools to convert existing assets into YuME
- Set the global scale to easily integrate YuME with your current assets or tools such as UFPS. - Create and store custom brushes
- Use layers to maximise the reuse of your assets
- Includes full source code, no DLLs.

Install to your [asset folder]/Yuponic/YuME.
